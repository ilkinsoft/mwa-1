We use setTimeout to call a function after a delay has finished.

We use setImmediate to call a function immediately but asynchronously.

So what is the difference between setTimeout with 0 delay and setImmediate? setTimeout with 0 delay may be slower
than setImmediate because js checks the timer at least once.

We use setImmediate if we want to push the function behind I/O event callbacks. We use process.nextTick to push the function to the head of the event queue. So, it is all about priority.
